Towering over even the heroic battle-brothers of his Chapter, Guilliman storms to war with a thunderous scowl. He clutches the burning sword of the Emperor, and wears the Hand of Dominion, with which he can tear apart tanks and crush his foes with ease. Yet it is the Primarchâ€™s strategic brilliance that is his greatest weapon, dooming enemies to defeat before the battle has even begun.`,
